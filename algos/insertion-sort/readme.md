### Insertion Sort

Insert sort is a type of sorting algorithm that rearranges elements in sequential order just like a deck of cards.

For each given list eg, [3, 6, 8, 20].

- Starting at the first index i = 1, sort values before in correct order such that i > i - 1
- Once sorted proceed to next index i+1 until all sorting is completed

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n2) where n is the number of items in the list.
